0.21  Tue May 18 10:31:47 2010
    - make open3 error handle a glob ref so it is not duped into the read handle (duh!)
    - Memory pedantic system fixups:
       - make use of open3 optional
       - comment out strict and warnings (should still run under them)
       - put POD in different file (doesn't really gain anything, mainly for easing worried minds)
  
0.20  Thu May 13 08:03:15 2010
    - pidfile END block only unlink if PID in file is $$ (so fork()s won't bork a process not their own via END copy)
    - start doing changelog top down
